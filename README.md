This is not my game!

I have been trying to lean Java. This code is from me memorizing a code from a Youtube video. 
This is a way for me to learn how things work practically. This way of learning helped me understand
how to utilize the theory and syntax I've been keeping up with. 
The link for vid #1 is here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gir2R7G9ws

I have only posted vid 1's code (Window Class, Game Class) but I memorized and understand up until vid #4.
I will continue to upload progress until I fully understand all of the code the youtube video presents.
Eventually I will change certain things to my liking, and possibly improving the overall code once I am 
more advanced.
